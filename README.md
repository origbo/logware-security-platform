# Logware Security Operations Platform

A comprehensive security operations platform providing end-to-end visibility and control over an organization's security posture.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Material-UI for consistent UI components with support for light/dark themes
- Redux Toolkit for state management with RTK Query for API interactions
- React Router for navigation with protected routes
- D3.js and Chart.js for data visualization and network topology mapping
- React Testing Library and Jest for component testing

### Backend
- Node.js with Express for a scalable API layer
- MongoDB for primary database (user data, configurations, alerts)
- Elasticsearch for log storage and searching capabilities
- Redis for caching and real-time messaging
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- WebSockets for real-time alerts and notifications

### Security Features
- CSRF protection for all API endpoints
- Content Security Policy implementation
- Rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Input validation and sanitization
- Regular security audits with automated tools

### Deployment
- Docker containers for all services
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
