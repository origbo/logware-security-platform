# SOAR Module User Guide

## Overview

The Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) module provides a comprehensive suite of tools for security teams to streamline incident response, automate routine security tasks, detect anomalies, and collaborate effectively during security incidents.

## Main Components

### 1. Dashboard

The SOAR Dashboard serves as the central hub for all SOAR activities. It provides an overview of:

- Active incidents requiring attention
- Recent automation executions
- Key performance metrics
- Quick access to commonly used tools

### 2. Automation

#### Automation Rules Manager

The Automation Rules Manager allows you to create, edit, and manage rules that automatically respond to security events:

- **Create Rules**: Define triggers, conditions, and actions
- **Test Rules**: Validate rules with test data before deployment
- **Monitor Rules**: Track rule execution statistics and success rates
- **Enable/Disable Rules**: Quickly activate or deactivate rules as needed

#### Playbook Orchestrator

The Playbook Orchestrator enables the design and execution of comprehensive security response workflows:

- **Visual Designer**: Drag-and-drop interface for building playbooks
- **Step Library**: Pre-built steps for common security tasks
- **Conditional Logic**: Branch execution paths based on results
- **Playbook Templates**: Start from templates for common incident types

#### Response Actions Library

The Response Actions Library provides a collection of pre-built security actions:

- **Categorized Actions**: Find actions by category (containment, eradication, etc.)
- **Integration Actions**: Connect with security tools in your environment
- **Custom Scripts**: Create custom actions with scripts
- **Testing Tools**: Test actions in isolation before adding to playbooks

#### Automation Execution Dashboard

The Execution Dashboard allows you to monitor and manage automation executions:

- **Active Executions**: View currently running automations with real-time progress
- **Execution History**: Review past executions with filtering and search
- **Performance Metrics**: Analyze success rates and execution times
- **Audit Logs**: Track all automation activities for compliance

### 3. Anomaly Detection

#### User Behavior Analytics

Monitor user activity for suspicious behavior:

- **User Risk Scores**: Identify high-risk users
- **Behavior Baselines**: Detect deviations from normal behavior
- **Activity Timeline**: Review suspicious user actions
- **Contextual Information**: Understand why activities are flagged

#### Network Traffic Analysis

Identify suspicious network activity:

- **Traffic Visualization**: Visual representation of network anomalies
- **Connection Analysis**: Identify unusual connections and destinations
- **Protocol Violations**: Detect deviations from expected protocols
- **Geo-mapping**: Visualize suspicious geographic connections

#### Explainable AI

Understand why anomalies were detected:

- **Factor Analysis**: View the key factors contributing to detections
- **Similar Incidents**: Compare with historical incidents
- **Recommendation Engine**: Get suggested response actions
- **Model Insights**: Understand the ML models' decision process

### 4. Threat Hunting

The Threat Hunting Dashboard enables proactive searching for threats:

- **Hunt Creation**: Define custom hunt parameters
- **Data Source Selection**: Choose where to hunt for threats
- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Map hunts to tactics and techniques
- **Hunt Results**: View and export findings
- **Hunt Scheduling**: Automate recurring hunts

### 5. Collaboration

The Collaborative Response Hub facilitates team coordination during incidents:

- **Real-time Chat**: Communicate with team members
- **Resource Sharing**: Share findings and evidence
- **Task Assignment**: Delegate and track response tasks
- **Timeline View**: Maintain a chronological record of response actions
- **Status Tracking**: Monitor response progress

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the SOAR Dashboard** by clicking on "SOAR" in the main navigation
2. **Explore the Overview** to get a sense of current security status
3. **Create your first Automation Rule**:
   - Go to the Automation section
   - Click on "Rules Manager"
   - Click "Create Rule"
   - Follow the guided workflow
4. **Execute a Playbook**:
   - Go to the Playbook Orchestrator
   - Select a template or create a new playbook
   - Click "Execute" and provide any required inputs
5. **Monitor Executions**:
   - Go to the Execution Dashboard to track progress
   - Review results when complete

## Best Practices

- Start with simple automation rules and gradually increase complexity
- Test all playbooks with sample data before using in production
- Use the collaboration features to document response procedures
- Review execution history regularly to identify opportunities for improvement
- Integrate threat intelligence sources for more effective detections

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Automation fails to execute**:
   - Check integration connectivity
   - Verify input parameters
   - Review action permissions

2. **Playbook stuck in running state**:
   - Check for stuck actions in the execution details
   - Verify external service availability
   - Use the abort function if necessary

3. **Rule not triggering**:
   - Verify trigger configuration
   - Check condition logic
   - Review event source settings

4. **Slow dashboard performance**:
   - Reduce date range for queries
   - Apply additional filters
   - Close unused dashboard tabs
